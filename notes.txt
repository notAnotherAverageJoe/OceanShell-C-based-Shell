Could It Be Like a Real-Life Shell?
Absolutely! With some enhancements:

Expand Parsing Capabilities: Support for arguments and flags (e.g., waves -f filename).
Add Built-In Variables: Let users set and use variables in your shell.
Scripting Support: Enable execution of "OceanLife scripts" with your custom commands.
Add More Ocean Commands: For example:
"current": List files (like ls).
"sink": Close the shell with a splash.
"buoy": Display help for commands.
Your shell could become a delightful, themed interface for interacting with the system! ðŸŒŠ
