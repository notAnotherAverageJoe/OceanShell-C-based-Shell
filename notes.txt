Could It Be Like a Real-Life Shell?
Absolutely! With some enhancements:

Expand Parsing Capabilities: Support for arguments and flags (e.g., waves -f filename).
Add Built-In Variables: Let users set and use variables in your shell.
Scripting Support: Enable execution of "OceanLife scripts" with your custom commands.
Add More Ocean Commands: For example:
"current": List files (like ls).
"sink": Close the shell with a splash.
"buoy": Display help for commands.
Your shell could become a delightful, themed interface for interacting with the system! ðŸŒŠ



Add More Command Features: Consider adding other helpful commands, such as ls (list files), clear (clear screen), or pwd (print working directory).
Error Handling: Add more detailed error messages, especially for cases like trying to delete a file that doesn't exist or trying to write to a file thatâ€™s not writable.
User Experience: Implement color coding (using ANSI escape codes) for better user experience, like success messages in green and errors in red.
